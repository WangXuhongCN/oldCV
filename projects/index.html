These graph scenarios have the characteristics of large data volume, real-time capability and strong correlation. Once a system abnormality occurs, the large, instantaneous, interlocking system failures it causes may bring hundreds of millions of economic losses. Previous graph algorithms were based on graph theory or graph Laplacian matrix, which brought extremely high learning costs to developers in the industry. Based on that，we combine the powerful representation ability of GNNs along with the classical anomaly detection technique, Because the topology information on the graph is automatically extracted by the GNNs, People can handle GAD problem without complicated graph theory.</p> <p>Keywords：<em>Anomaly Detection, Graph Neural Network, Unsupervised Learning, Graph Mining</em></p></div></div> <div class="md-card"><div class="card-image"><img src="/projects/GNN-Drug.png" alt></div> <div class="card-content"><p><strong>Graph Neural Network based Drug Discovering</strong>   -- Supported by Intel Co.</p> <p>Drug development is an expensive and time-consuming process where thousands of chemical compounds are being tested and
experiments are being conducted in order to find out drugs that are safe and effective. Many attempts have risen in using deep neural networks for application to drug development. However, most current deep models are still based on handcrafted features designed by field experts. Moreover, traditional machine learning methods lost their effectiveness in graph data. They can only handle Euclidean data (e.g., images, audio and texts and tabular data) and are not well suited for structured data like
molecules. In this research, we use popular graph neural networks to automatically extract molecular features. At the same time, label smoothing and AM-Softmax techniques is firstly applied to GNNs because the number of classes is huge.</p> <p>Keywords：<em>Drag Discover, Graph Neural Network, Graph Mining</em></p></div></div> <div class="md-card"><div class="card-image"><img src="/projects/advae.jpg" alt></div> <div class="card-content"><p><strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705119305283?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adVAE: A self-adversarial variational autoencoder with Gaussian anomaly prior knowledge for anomaly detection<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></strong> -- Supported by NSFC</p> <p>Anomaly detection can be regarded as the identification task of rare data items differing from the majority of the data. It is applicable in a variety of domains, such as intrusion detection, fraud detection, fault detection, health monitoring and security check. Recently, deep generative models have become increasingly popular in unsupervised anomaly detection. However, deep generative models aim at recovering the data distribution rather than detecting anomalies, which has a indirect contribution to detecting anomalies. We propose a self-adversarial Variational Autoencoder (adVAE) with a Gaussian anomaly prior assumption. Adversarial training is used to simulate the probability distribution of anomalous samples in hidden space, thereby converting unsupervised anomaly detection problems into supervised problems. Compared with other competitive methods, the proposed model achieves significant improvements in extensive experiments.</p> <p>Keywords：<em>Anomaly Detection, Deep Generative Model, Variational Autoencoder, Unsupervised Learning</em></p></div></div> <h2 id="project">Project</h2> <div class="md-card"><div class="card-image"><img src="/projects/KFBIO.png" alt></div> <div class="card-content"><p><strong>Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Technology for Pap Smear</strong>  -- Supported by Intel Co.</p> <p>Every year, hundreds of millions of people in the world need to use medical imaging tests to rule out, diagnose and locate lesions. However, the level and experience of medical imaging analysts vary, and in the face of intractable diseases, only a few outstanding experts can complete the diagnosis, which has caused unfairness in medical resources. People have tried to use machine learning to detect lesions. However, these methods face difficulties in obtaining data, leakage of patient privacy, and missed diagnosis. In this project, we developed an assisted diagnosis system for cervical cancer slices (Pap Smear), using unsupervised image anomaly detection technology, learning a high-dimensional probability distribution of a large number of normal slices. Once the model finds that the slices deviate from the normal distribution, it will promptly warn the doctor. The model can improve the diagnosis speed and reduce the rate of missed diagnosis.</p> <p>Tech: <em>Pytorch, Python, OpenCV, C++</em></p></div></div> <div class="md-card"><div class="card-image"><img src="/projects/powergird.jpg" alt></div> <div class="card-content"><p><strong>Data Fusion and Diagnosis Backend System for Substation Inspection Robot</strong>  -- Supported by China Southern Power Grid Co.</p> <p>China has one of the largest power grid system in the world. However, substation equipment requires huge human and other necessary costs to ensure its normal work. In addition, there are some safety issues that cannot be ignored using manual inspection. Although the substation inspection robot has helped the power inspection in recent years, its backend data analysis and processing processes are still not intelligent and automated, and rely on manual monitoring by backend staff. To solve the above problems, we standardized the data collection and interaction process between the robot and the backend server, and combined timing analysis technology and anomaly detection algorithms to automatically detect, locate and forecast faults. A simple and easy to learn backend monitoring platform is also provided for power inspection personnel.</p> <p>Tech: <em>SQL, Flask, Python, C++, CLIPS</em></p></div></div> <div class="md-card"><div class="card-image"><img src="/projects/micro.png" alt></div> <div class="card-content"><p><strong>Smart Braille Reader</strong><br>
